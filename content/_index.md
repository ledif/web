I am a Middleware Development Engineer for [oneAPI](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/overview.html) at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html). I hold a PhD in Computer Science from [Texas A&M University](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html) where I conducted research in the [Parasol Lab](https://parasollab.web.illinois.edu). Previously, I was a Senior Quantitative Developer at [Quantlab](https://quantlab.com) focusing on low-latency code for algorithmic trading systems. During my PhD, I interned at [Google Search](https://ai.google/research/teams/algorithms-optimization/graph-mining) developing parallel graph algorithms for massive scale graphs.
