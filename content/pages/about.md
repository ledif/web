## The stars at night

I'm a computer scientist with interests in high-performance software, specifically
parallel computing, distributed graph algorithms and parallel algorithms. C++ is my
daily driver language but I'm always on the lookout for the next **big and bright** systems language
to steal my heart.

I've spent most of my life **deep in the heart of Texas**, primarily against my will.
